a)
i) a game is a system with:
- **2 or more** agents (players) who can make moves
- A strict set of rules defining what the moves a player can make are, and what comes of them
- A set of payoffs returned to players upon a game's completion, **depending on everyone's moves**

ii) A nash equilibrium is **a set of strategies for each player**, where all players are performing their best response strategy, considering all other strategies. There is no incentive to deviate when in this state.

iii) A mixed strategy is one which involves randomly selecting a strategy based on a probability distribution for each of your strategies.

b) Zermelos theorem. It is true if it is a 2P, zero-sum, perfect-info, finite game without chance.

d) x * 1 + 1-x * -1
x * -1 + 1-x * 2
x + x - 1 = -x - 2x + 2
5x = 3
x = 3/5

y * 1 + 1-y * -1 = y * -1 + 1-y * 2
y + y - 1 = -y + 2 - 2y
5y = 3
3/5
3/5 pick a, 2/5 pick b for both

2)
b) Bet. The payoff of betting with a head is either +2, +1 or 0, whereas folding is -1. Betting is guaranteed to be better than folding, **it dominates folding.**
c) Bet. For the same reason that it dominates folding.
d) sure.
