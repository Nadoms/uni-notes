# W9.2 - Information Extraction
Goal: Extract and structure facts from text e.g. into a table.
1. Identify entities
- Persons, jobs, locations, companies, dates, etc.
- Designed for each class of interest
- Find strings in text denoting specific mentions

### Named Entity Recognition
Find and classify names in text.
**Document-level NER** - Extracting names from a document.
**Mention-level NER** - Locating names in a document. (Much harder for LLMs)
Approaches:
1. Dictionary lookup
- Recognises entities stored in dictionaries
- Impossible to enumerate all names and variants
- May have ambiguity
2. Rule-based approach
- Use context clues to indicate entity types
- e.g. <title> <capitalised word> will usually be a name.
3. ML sequence labelling for NER
- Consider named entities as sequences of tokens in text
- Utilising part of speech tagging
- Can encode beginning of names / inside of names (chunking, e.g. B-PER, I-PER)
4. Using transformers for NER
- Use transfer learning
- Pretrain a large neural network then do fine-tuning at the token level
- BERT doesn't take into account dependencies between tags
- Hence common practice to add a CRF layer on top of the classifier

### Domain Adaptation
There are different entity types in different domains (e.g. news, movies).
NER models can be adpated from one domain to another through adaptation through further training.
